# CS-305-Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
The module that I was able to do well was producing static tests as well as suppressing false negatives

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I had a hard time genertating a checksum on my current computer. I was working out of state and the computer I was familiar with ended up being fried therefore I had to get a replacement that I struggled to get use to throughout the term. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? 
I was able to suppress false negatives on vulnerablity reports which allow the team to focus on other vulnerablities until new solutions arise.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I would periodically check the software functionality throughout the testing process.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I referes to the textbook when I needed help with the projects as well as the reference matarial.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I will be able to show employeers that I understand the concept of deploying vulnerability reports.
